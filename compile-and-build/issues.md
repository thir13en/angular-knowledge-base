##### Problem
When trying to build or serve a project, we have many compile errors related to the 
node-sass library

##### Solution
It is due to node not having enough permissions and probably we have some
problems and errors at the moment of installing dependencies with npm i.
To fix this we first need to fix permission problems with node
